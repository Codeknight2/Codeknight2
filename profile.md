Delegate Statement

My goal is to turn Maker into a trillion-dollar entity that is easy to understand and decentralized. I am committed to helping grow Maker into a sustainable, profitable system.
To do this, I will emphasize reducing complexity and building easy to evaluate processes, to ensure that both delegates and Maker holders can understand the protocol and it's governance. Simplicity is essential to decentralization, both to avoid hidden centralization points and to identify potential weaknesses and waste. I am a believer in incremental improvement, so I am just as interested in little ideas to make things run more smoothly as big sweeping changes.
I will support proposals that provide strong risk-adjusted returns, with clear metrics to evaluate their success. I will object to proposals with unjustifiably high costs or that don’t fit into the wider Maker ecosystem and it’s budget.
As a delegate, I commit to providing honesty, transparency and openness to both Maker holders and the community.
 
Conflicts of Interest

I have positions in Eth and Truefi’s tokens. I will abstain from any votes related to Truefi. Otherwise, I do not derive income from any potential partner or competitor of Maker.
